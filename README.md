Old Electric Potential Visualizer for Windows made with C++, FreeGLUT, GLEW and OpenGL

## Info:
Originally made for a school project in 2020. Found a partially finished backup of the original code and patched it up somewhat into a semi-functional viewer. Modify parameters in the code and build with the supplied makefile for Windows.
